4. What will be the output of the following Java program?

    class A 
    {
        int i;
        void display() 
        {
            System.out.println(i);
        }
    }    
    class B extends A 
    {
        int j;
        void display() 
        {
            System.out.println(j);
        }
    }    
    class inheritance_demo 
    {
        public static void main(String args[])
        {
            B obj = new B();
            obj.i=1;
            obj.j=2;   
            obj.display();     
        }
   }

12. Which among the following best describes polymorphism?
a) It is the ability for a message/data to be processed in more than one form
b) It is the ability for a message/data to be processed in only 1 form
c) It is the ability for many messages/data to be processed in one way
d) It is the ability for undefined message/data to be processed in at least one way
Answer: a
Explanation: It is actually the ability for a message / data to be processed in more than one form. The word polymorphism indicates many-forms. So if a single entity takes more than one form, it is known as polymorphism.

13. Which among the following can’t be used for polymorphism?
a) Static member functions
b) Member functions overloading
c) Predefined operator overloading
d) Constructor overloading
Answer: a
Explanation: Static member functions are not property of any object. Hence it can’t be considered for overloading/overriding. For polymorphism, function must be property of object, not only of class.

14) What concepts come under Polymorphism in java?

a)Method overloading
b)Constructor overloading
c)Method overriding
d)All the above

	}

	public void Color(int x, int y, int z) {
	}
}
a)Method overloading
b)Constructor overloading
c)Method overriding

a)Method overloading
b)Constructor overloading
c)Method overriding
d)Both A and B
e)Both A and C
Answer: D
Method overloading, and constructor overloading come under compile time polymorphism. as compiler resolves overloaded method at compile time. in simple word, compiler can understand which overloaded method or constructor to call at compile time itself.

18) Which method of base class X, the derived class Y cannot override?
class X {
	final public void m1() {
	}

	public void m2() {
	}
}
class Y extends X {
	// override?
}
a)m1()
b)m2()
c)Both m1() and m2() can override
d)No method can override
Answer: A
Explanation: Derive class Y cannot Override base class method m1() as this method is declared as final.

Answer: A
Constructor of a class cannot be inherited. But note that they can be invoked from a derived class. final method can be inherited just they cannot be overridden in sub class.
