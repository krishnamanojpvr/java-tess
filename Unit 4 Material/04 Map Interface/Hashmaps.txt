What is Hashmap in Java?

-->A HashMap basically designates unique keys to corresponding values that can be retrieved at any given point. 

--->Working with HashMap in Java 

Features of Java Hashmap

a) The values can be stored in a map by forming a key-value pair. 
     The value can be retrieved using the key by passing it to the correct method.

b) If no element exists in the Map, it will throw a ‘NoSuchElementException’.

c) HashMap stores only object references. 
    That is why, it is impossible to use primitive data types like double or int.
    Use wrapper class (like Integer or Double) instead.


-->Using HashMaps in Java Programs:

      Following are the two ways to declare a Hash Map:

    1.      HashMap<String, Object> map = new HashMap<String, Object>();

     2.     HashMap x  = new HashMap();

-->Important Hashmap Methods 

	-->get(Object KEY) – This will return the value associated with a specified key in this Java hashmap.
	-->put(Object KEY, String VALUE) – This method stores the specified value and associates it with the specified key in this map.
